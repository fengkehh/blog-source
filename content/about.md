Data analysis is really just a fancy name for the art of making connections. 
Believe it or not, we all use it in our lives. We start collecting data as soon 
as we are born in the form of personal experience. We then use the data to derive 
properties about the world we live in. However, sometimes things are not immediately 
clear. Furthermore, things can seem obvious but actually mean the exact opposite. 
That is why scientists have developed very rigorous methods and standards 
when it comes to data analysis. This blog aims to talk about some aspects of 
data analysis as I work with real data and hopefully you can find them useful 
one day.

I started this blog in early 2017 after I got my Master's degree in physics and 
all of a sudden found myself a bit lost on what to do next. Having spent most of 
my life in school my academic experience is plenty but my professional experience 
is certainly lacking. I decided that this blog will serve as a platform for me to 

1. Practice and improve my skills by working with real data.
2. Highlight interesting subtleties.
3. Showcase my abilities to potential employers ;).

I hope you find my blog interesting. If you believe you have spotted something 
due for a second look please feel free to join the fray using Disqus. Thanks for 
reading!
